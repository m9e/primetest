"Is 17747 a prime number? Think step by step and then answer ""[Yes]"" or ""[No]"".",gpt-4-0314,"Step 1: Check if the number is even. If it is, then it is not prime. 17747 is odd, so we proceed to the next step. |  | Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by any odd prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 17747 is approximately 133.2. |  | Step 3: Check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 17747 is 1 + 7 + 7 + 4 + 7 = 26, which is not divisible by 3. So, 17747 is not divisible by 3. |  | Step 4: Check for divisibility by 5. The last digit of 17747 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. |  | Step 5: Check for divisibility by 7. Using the divisibility rule for 7, we double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining number: 1774 - (2 * 7) = 1774 - 14 = 1760. Repeating the process, we get 176 - (2 * 0) = 176. Since 176 is not divisible by 7, neither is 17747. |  | Step 6: Check for divisibility by 11. Using the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the sum of the alternating digits from the sum of the remaining digits: (1 + 7 + 7) - (7 + 4) = 15 - 11 = 4. Since 4 is not divisible by 11, neither is 17747. |  | Step 7: Check for divisibility by 13.
