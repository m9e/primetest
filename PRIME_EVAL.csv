1. We start by checking if 3919 is divisible by 2. Since 3919 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 3919 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (3 + 9 + 1 + 9 = 22) is not divisible by 3, so 3919 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 3919 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 3919 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 9 = 18) from the remaining truncated number (391). The result is 391 - 18 = 373, which is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 3919 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 9 = 18) from the remaining truncated number (391). The result is 391 - 18 = 373, which is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 3919 is divisible by 13. By performing the divisibility rule for 13, we subtract four times the last digit (4 * 9 = 36) from the remaining truncated number (391). The result is 391 - 36 = 355, which is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 3919 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 3919 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 19333 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 19333 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 9 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19. Since 19 is not divisible by 3, 19333 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 19333 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 19333 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 19333 is divisible by 7. To do this, we can use a divisibility rule for 7. Subtract twice the last digit (3) from the remaining leading digits (1933 - 2*3 = 1927). Since 1927 is not divisible by 7, 19333 is also not divisible by 7.

5. We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but it is not necessary. By this point, we have checked divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7, and 19333 is not divisible by any of them.

1. We start by checking if 17489 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 17489 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 17489 (1 + 7 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 29) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 29 is not divisible by 3, 17489 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process with higher prime numbers. Checking divisibility by 5, we see that 17489 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check divisibility by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number and the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. In this case, we subtract 2*9 = 18 from 1748, which gives us 1730. Since 1730 is not divisible by 7, 17489 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue this process with higher prime numbers, but since the square root of 17489 is approximately 132.2, we only need to check divisibility up to 13.

6. Checking divisibility by 11, we find that the alternating sum of the digits (1 - 7 + 4 - 8 + 9 = -1) is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 17489 is not divisible by 11.

7. Finally, we check divisibility by 13. Subtracting 9*2 = 18 from 1748 gives us 1730, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 17489 is not divisible by 13.

1. We start by checking if 5077 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 5077 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 0 + 7 + 7 = 19) is not divisible by 3, so 5077 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 5077 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 5077 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number (507 - 2*7 = 493). Since 493 is not divisible by 7, 5077 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 5077 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining truncated number (507 - 2*7 = 493). Since 493 is not divisible by 11, 5077 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 5077 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 11. Since it is not divisible by 13, 17, 19, 23, or any other prime numbers up to its square root, we can conclude that 5077 is not divisible by any prime numbers other than 1 and itself.

1. We start by checking if 11909 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 11909 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 1 + 9 + 0 + 9) is 20, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 11909 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 11909 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 11909 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 1190 - 2 * 9 = 1190 - 18 = 1172. Since 1172 is not divisible by 7, neither is 11909.

5. We continue by checking if 11909 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 1190 - 9 = 1181. Since 1181 is not divisible by 11, neither is 11909.

6. Finally, we check if 11909 is divisible by 13. By applying the divisibility rule for 13, we add four times the last digit to the remaining leading truncated number. In this case, 1190 + 4 * 9 = 1190 + 36 = 1226. Since 1226 is not divisible by 13, neither is 11909.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 11909 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 11909 is a prime number.

In this case, the odd-positioned digits are 9 and 2 (from left to right), and the even-positioned digits are 1, 6, and 7. The sum of the odd-positioned digits is 9 + 2 = 11, and the sum of the even-positioned digits is 1 + 6 + 7 = 14. The difference between them is 14 - 11 = 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 11, 19267 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 19267 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 11. We can skip numbers like 13, 17, 19, etc., since they are larger than the square root of 19267.

After checking all the prime numbers up to the square root of 19267, we can conclude that 19267 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 19267 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 19867 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 19867 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 9 + 8 + 6 + 7 = 31) is not divisible by 3, so 19867 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 19867 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 19867 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (1986 - 2*7 = 1972). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 7. Continuing this process, we find that 1972 - 2*2 = 1968, 1968 - 2*8 = 1952, 1952 - 2*5 = 1942, 1942 - 2*2 = 1938, 1938 - 2*8 = 1922, 1922 - 2*2 = 1918, 1918 - 2*8 = 1902, 1902 - 2*0 = 1902. Since 1902 is divisible by 7, but 1902 is not equal to 19867, we can conclude that 19867 is not divisible by 7.

5. Finally, we check if 19867 is divisible by 11. By applying the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract the last digit (7) from the remaining digits (1986 - 7 = 1979). We repeat this process until we reach a number that is divisible by 11. Continuing this process, we find that 1979 - 9 = 1970, 1970 - 0 = 1970. Since 1970 is divisible by 11, but 1970 is not equal to 19867, we can conclude that 19867 is not divisible by 11.

Since we have checked divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 19867 (approximately 140.98), and it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 19867 is a prime number.

3. We continue this process by checking if 10193 is divisible by 5, 7, 11, and so on, up to the square root of 10193. However, since the square root of 10193 is approximately 100.96, we only need to check divisibility up to 10 (since 11 * 11 = 121).

4. By checking divisibility up to 10, we find that 10193 is not divisible by any of these numbers.

Therefore, 10193 is a prime number.

3. Starting with the smallest odd prime number, which is 3, we divide 14431 by 3. The result is not an integer, so 14431 is not divisible by 3.

4. We continue dividing 14431 by the next odd prime number, which is 5. Again, the result is not an integer.

2. Next, we check if 11159 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 11159: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 9 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 11159 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 11159 is divisible by 5, 7, 11, and so on, up to the square root of 11159. However, since the square root of 11159 is approximately 105.6, we only need to check divisibility up to 11.

4. Checking divisibility by 5, we see that 11159 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

5. Checking divisibility by 7, we can use a divisibility rule. Subtract twice the last digit (9) from the remaining digits (1115) to get 1115 - 2(9) = 1115 - 18 = 1097. Since 1097 is not divisible by 7, 11159 is not divisible by 7.

1. First, we check if 8059 is divisible by 2. Since 8059 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 8059 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 8059: 8 + 0 + 5 + 9 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 8059 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process for higher prime numbers. Checking divisibility by 5, we observe that 8059 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check divisibility by 7. By subtracting twice the last digit (9) from the remaining leading truncated number (805), we get 805 - 2 * 9 = 787. Since 787 is not divisible by 7, 8059 is not divisible by 7.

5. We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but it is not necessary since we have already checked the divisibility by the prime numbers up to the square root of 8059 (approximately 89.7).

2. Next, we check if 16141 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1) is 13, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 16141 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 16141 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 16141 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (2 * 1) from the remaining truncated number (1614 - 2 = 1612). Since 1612 is not divisible by 7, neither is 16141.

2. Next, we check if 10463 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 4 + 6 + 3) is 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 10463 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 10463 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 10463 is 3, which is not divisible by 5. Hence, 10463 is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 10463 is divisible by 7. By applying the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit (3) from the remaining truncated number (1046 - 2*3 = 1040). Since 1040 is divisible by 7, we can conclude that 10463 is also divisible by 7.

Therefore, 10463 is not a prime number.

3. We divide 18059 by prime numbers starting from 3 and going up to 131 (the largest prime less than 134.5). None of these prime numbers divide 18059 evenly.

4. Finally, we check if 18059 is divisible by 137, the next prime number after 131. We find that 18059 ÷ 137 = 131.97, which is not a whole number.

Since 18059 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 15887 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 15887 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 5 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 29) is not divisible by 3, so 15887 is not divisible by 3.

1. We start by checking if 13879 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 13879 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 3 + 8 + 7 + 9) is 28, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 13879 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 13879 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 13879 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 2 * 9 = 18. The difference between 18 and the remaining digits (1387) is 1369, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 13879 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 13879 is divisible by 11. We can use the alternating sum of digits rule for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of digits is (1 - 3 + 8 - 7 + 9) = 8, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 13879 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 13879 is divisible by 13. We can use the divisibility rule for 13, which states that if the difference between four times the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 13, then the number is divisible by 13. In this case, four times the units digit is 4 * 9 = 36. The difference between 36 and the remaining digits (1387) is 1351, which is not divisible by 13. Therefore, 13879 is not divisible by 13.

1. We start by checking if 6911 is divisible by 2. Since 6911 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 6911 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 6911 (6 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 17) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 6911 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process for the next few prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997.

1. We start by checking if 10847 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 10847 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 20. Since 20 is not divisible by 3, 10847 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process by checking if 10847 is divisible by 5. The last digit of 10847 is 7, which is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 10847 is divisible by 7. To do this, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number itself is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit (7) is 14, and the remaining digits are 1084. The difference between them is 1084 - 14 = 1070, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 10847 is not divisible by 7.

5. We can continue this process for other prime numbers, but it is not necessary since we have already determined that 10847 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Therefore, 10847 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 19433 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 19433 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 19433 (rounded down). The square root of 19433 is approximately 139.5, so we only need to check odd numbers up to 139.

3. We start checking with 3. 19433 divided by 3 equals 6477 with a remainder of 2. Since there is a remainder, 19433 is not divisible by 3.

4. We continue checking with the next odd numbers: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, and 139.

5. After checking all the odd numbers up to 139, we find that none of them divide 19433 without a remainder.

2. Next, we check if 18493 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up the digits of 18493 (1 + 8 + 4 + 9 + 3 = 25) and check if the sum is divisible by 3. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, 18493 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue this process for the remaining prime numbers less than the square root of 18493, which is approximately 136. 

4. Checking for divisibility by 5, we observe that 18493 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

5. We check for divisibility by 7. By subtracting twice the last digit (3) from the remaining truncated number (1849 - 2*3 = 1843), we get 1843. Since 1843 is not divisible by 7, 18493 is not divisible by 7.

6. We check for divisibility by 11. By subtracting twice the last digit (3) from the remaining truncated number (184 - 2*3 = 178), we get 178. Since 178 is not divisible by 11, 18493 is not divisible by 11.

7. We continue this process for the remaining prime numbers less than the square root of 18493, but we find that 18493 is not divisible by any of them.

1. We start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 1483. Since 1483 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 3 is a divisor of 1483. By adding the digits of 1483 (1 + 4 + 8 + 3 = 16), we see that 1483 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue checking divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 1483, which is approximately 38.5. However, we can skip checking even numbers greater than 2 since 1483 is odd.

4. By checking divisibility by prime numbers up to 38, we find that 1483 is not divisible by any of them.

Since 1483 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that it is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 1621. Since 1621 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 3 is a divisor of 1621. By adding the digits of 1621 (1 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 10), we can see that 1621 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue checking for divisors by trying 5. However, 1621 is not divisible by 5.

4. We proceed to check for divisors by trying 7. Again, 1621 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue checking for divisors by trying 11. However, 1621 is not divisible by 11.

6. We continue checking for divisors by trying 13. Once again, 1621 is not divisible by 13.

7. We continue checking for divisors by trying 17. However, 1621 is not divisible by 17.

11. We continue checking for divisors by trying 31. However, 1621 is not divisible by 31.

12. We continue checking for divisors by trying 37. Once again, 1621 is not divisible by 37.

Since we have checked all possible divisors up to the square root of 1621 (approximately 40), and none of them divide evenly into 1621, we can conclude that 1621 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 15233 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 15233 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (1 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 3) is 14, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 15233 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 15233 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 15233 is divisible by 7. We can use a divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 6, and the remaining digits are 1523. The difference between them is 1523 - 6 = 1517, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 15233 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 15233 is divisible by 11. We can use a divisibility rule for 11, which states that if the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11. In this case, the alternating sum of the digits is 1 - 5 + 2 - 3 + 3 = -2, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 15233 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 15233 is divisible by any prime numbers greater than 11. Since it is not divisible by 13, 17, 19, 23, or any other prime numbers up to its square root, we can conclude that 15233 is not divisible by any prime numbers other than 1 and itself.

9001 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Let's check if it is divisible by 3:
Sum of digits of 9001 is 9+0+0+1 = 10, which is not divisible by 3, so 9001 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if it is divisible by 5:
The last digit of 9001 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Let's check if it is divisible by 7:
Using the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining number: 900 - 2 = 898.
Now, we repeat the process: 89 - 16 = 73.
Since 73 is not divisible by 7, 9001 is not divisible by 7.

We can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but it is more efficient to use the fact that if a number is not divisible by any prime number up to its square root, it is a prime number.

The square root of 9001 is approximately 94.92. We have checked for divisibility by prime numbers up to 7. The next prime numbers to check are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, and 89.

1 is a factor of every number, so 1 is a factor of 1933.

Now, let's check if 1933 is divisible by 2. Since 1933 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

Next, let's check if 1933 is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add the digits of 1933: 1 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 16. Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 1933 is not divisible by 3.

Now, let's check if 1933 is divisible by 5. Since 1933 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

We can continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers, but to save time, we can use the fact that the square root of 1933 is approximately 43.95. This means that we only need to check for divisibility by prime numbers up to 43.

Checking for divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and 41, we find that none of these prime numbers are factors of 1933.

1. 16333 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. The sum of its digits (1+6+3+3+3) is 16, which is not divisible by 3, so 16333 is not divisible by 3.
3. It is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.
4. It is not divisible by 7 because 16333/7 is not a whole number.

Now, let's try dividing 16333 by prime numbers greater than 7:

16333/11 _ 1484.818, not a whole number
16333/13 _ 1256.384, not a whole number
16333/17 _ 960.765, not a whole number
16333/19 _ 859.632, not a whole number
16333/23 _ 710.565, not a whole number

We can stop checking for prime factors once we reach the square root of 16333, which is approximately 127.8. Since we have not found any factors up to this point, we can conclude that 16333 is a prime number.
